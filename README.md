we found the root cause, because of not removing the "lastpalyitem" data from localstorage, when relaunching application the mediadiscovery home content is getting updated paralelly the data from "lastplayeditem" is loaded and the current_scene in app_status inside redux store is updated with "video". that's why video player is loaded again. we contacted athulya, she replied that this issue is already fixed and she gave details about that patch. we cherrypicked that patch and I created the clean engineering build and tested it. it is working fine.
